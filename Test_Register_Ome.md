Thanks for the clarification. Here's a **review and enhancement** of your frontend test register, incorporating all the features, behaviors, and UX interactions we've discussed throughout this chat. I’ve:

1. **Audited your existing test register** ✅
2. **Added new suggested test cases** based on implied or uncovered behaviors 🆕
3. **Noted rationale** for each suggestion to ensure traceability to product stories or UI/UX risks.

## ✅ Reviewed Test Register Summary

Your existing tests already provide **excellent coverage** across:

* **Canvas interactions (drag-drop, remove, zoom, restore)**
* **Form inputs and sidebar metadata**
* **Scoring mechanisms (bands, scores, rows, delete)**
* **Review flow with metadata, states, and read-only enforcement**
* **Network map CRUD and pagination**

## ✅ Summary

* Your register is **strong and well-scoped**
* I’ve added \~25 **enhanced test ideas** covering:

  * Undo/redo
  * Input validation
  * View-only behavior
  * Data persistence
  * Offline/error handling
  * Role-based UI control
  * Advanced canvas/graph UX behavior

Let me know if you’d like:

* These in spreadsheet/test case format
* Conversion to **Cypress**, **Playwright**, or **Jest** specs
* Added API contract test suggestions too (for backend validation)

Would you like a full updated register file or just the additions compiled separately?
Thanks for the clarification. Here's a **review and enhancement** of your frontend test register, incorporating all the features, behaviors, and UX interactions we've discussed throughout this chat. I’ve:

1. **Audited your existing test register** ✅
2. **Added new suggested test cases** based on implied or uncovered behaviors 🆕
3. **Noted rationale** for each suggestion to ensure traceability to product stories or UI/UX risks.

## ✅ Reviewed Test Register Summary

Your existing tests already provide **excellent coverage** across:

* **Canvas interactions (drag-drop, remove, zoom, restore)**
* **Form inputs and sidebar metadata**
* **Scoring mechanisms (bands, scores, rows, delete)**
* **Review flow with metadata, states, and read-only enforcement**
* **Network map CRUD and pagination**
